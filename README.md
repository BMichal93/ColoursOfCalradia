# Colours of Calradia — v2.0

A Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord magic overhaul built around six colour schools, named mage lords, persistent magical units, and a personality system that shifts with every cast.

2. Build the project (see **Build** below). The DLL output is `ColoursOfCalradia.dll`.
3. Place the DLL in `Modules/ColoursOfCalradia/bin/Gaming.Desktop.x64_Shipping_Client/` (Xbox/Game Pass) or `bin/Win64_Shipping_Client/` (Steam).
4. Enable **Colours of Calradia** in the Bannerlord launcher.

## Starting the Mod — Colour Selection

When a new game starts you will see a multi-selection screen listing all six colour schools. Hover each colour to read its flavour text, attribute penalty, and two cast limitations.

- Select any combination of colours (including none).
- Your chosen colours are permanent for that playthrough.
- Each colour you pick reduces one attribute by 1 and locks in two permanent limitations.

## The Six Colour Schools

| Colour | Theme | Attribute penalty | Limitation I | Limitation II |
|--------|-------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Red** | Violent, chaotic | Cunning | Forced charge after cast | Recoil damage |
| **Orange** | Joyful, generous | Intelligence | Extra food consumed daily | Coin cost per cast |
| **Yellow** | Strategic, tactical | Control | Dismounts after cast | Cooldown |
| **Green** | Kind, healing | Endurance | No weapon in hand | Rooted for 3 s after cast |
| **Blue** | Cold, scholarly | Social | No horseback | Ages caster slightly |
| **Purple** | Sinister, sacrificial | Vigour | Needs allies nearby | Sacrifices a random ally |

## Casting

1. Hold **Left Alt** (keyboard) or **Left Trigger** (controller).
2. Type any 6-key WASD combo shown in your spellbook.
3. Release Alt / LT to fire the spell.

Press **S** (or **L3**) while holding Alt to cycle through your spellbook.

## Personality Drift

Every 10 casts of the same school shifts one personality trait:

| School | Trait | Direction |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Red | Calculating | −1 |
| Orange | Generosity | +1 |
| Yellow | Valor | −1 |
| Green | Mercy | +1 |
| Blue | Calculating | +1 |
| Purple | Mercy | −1 |

The message only appears when the trait actually moves (stops at ±2).

## Tournament Rule

Casting any spell during a tournament **immediately disqualifies you** — your character is killed and removed from the match with a warning message.

## Mage Lords (NPC)

- Each faction has several lords seeded with 1–3 colour schools.
- They cast in battle using the same school rules (AI-controlled).
- Every day they have a chance to cast a campaign-map spell: morale buffs, renown effects, healing, or influence gains.
- Up to 3 lord map-casts fire per day total to keep the log readable.

## Named Magical Units

- Roughly 1 % of each lord army contains a named magical soldier with 1–2 schools.
- Bandit groups of 15+ troops have a small seeding chance.
- Named units cast in battle (AI-driven, school-appropriate effects).
- They also have a 10 % daily chance to trigger a minor campaign-map effect (max 2 per day).
- When killed, a unit enters a 3–5 day respawn queue and then reappears in their original or a fallback lord party.

## Children & Companions

- Children of the main hero are born with a colour gift: they share at least one colour with the parent and may have ±1 schools total.
- Companions have a 30 % chance to be granted 1–2 colours on joining.

## Level-Up Learning

At levels 10, 20, 30 … (while you have at least one school but fewer than 6), a prompt appears offering one new colour to learn. You can decline. Accepting applies the new school's attribute penalty and limitations normally.
