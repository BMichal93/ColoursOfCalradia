# Colours of Calradia — v1.2.0.0

A Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord magic overhaul built around six colour schools, named mage lords, persistent magical units, and a personality system that shifts with every cast.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Game:** Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord — Steam or Xbox / Game Pass
- **Version compatibility:** built against Bannerlord's current `.NET Framework 4.7.2` runtime; compatible with any game version that uses the same runtime

No build tools are needed for a normal install.

---

### Step 1 — Download the mod

Download the latest release ZIP from the Releases page. The ZIP contains:

```
ColoursOfCalradia/
    SubModule.xml
    install.ps1
    README.md
    ModuleData/
    bin/
        Win64_Shipping_Client/
            ColoursOfCalradia.dll
        Gaming.Desktop.x64_Shipping_Client/
            ColoursOfCalradia.dll
```

Extract the ZIP to any temporary location (Desktop, Downloads, etc.). You should end up with a single `ColoursOfCalradia` folder.

---

### Step 2 — Install

Choose whichever method you prefer. Both produce the same result.

---

#### Option A — Script install (recommended)

The release ZIP includes `install.ps1`, a PowerShell script that finds your game automatically and copies all files to the correct location.

**2a. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder**

Right-click inside the extracted `ColoursOfCalradia` folder while holding **Shift**, then choose **Open PowerShell window here**. On Windows 11 you may need to select **Show more options** first.

Alternatively: open PowerShell from the Start Menu, then navigate to the folder:

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\ColoursOfCalradia"
```

**2b. Allow the script to run (first-time only)**

Windows blocks unsigned scripts by default. Run this once per PowerShell session to allow it — it does not permanently change your system policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

**2c. Run the installer**

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

The script automatically checks:
1. The Steam registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Valve\Steam` and `HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam`)
2. The default Steam path (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`)
3. All subdirectories of `C:\XboxGames\` (Xbox / Game Pass installs)

If detection succeeds you will see:

```
Detected Bannerlord at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord
Platform bin: Win64_Shipping_Client
Using DLL: ...\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\ColoursOfCalradia.dll
Installed successfully to: ...\Modules\ColoursOfCalradia
```

**Non-standard install location**

If you installed Bannerlord outside the default Steam library (e.g. a second drive), pass the path explicitly:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -BannerlordPath "D:\Games\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord"
```

For Xbox / Game Pass with a known GUID folder:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -BannerlordPath "C:\XboxGames\Mount & Blade II- Bannerlord\Content"
```

---

#### Option B — Manual install

**2a. Find your Bannerlord root directory**

| Platform | How to find it |
|----------|---------------|
| Steam (default library) | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord` |
| Steam (custom library) | Open Steam → right-click Bannerlord → Manage → Browse local files |
| Xbox / Game Pass | Open `C:\XboxGames\` in Explorer; Bannerlord's folder contains a `Content` subfolder that has a `bin` folder inside it |

The correct root is the folder that contains both a `bin` subfolder and a `Modules` subfolder.

**2b. Copy the mod folder**

Copy the entire `ColoursOfCalradia` folder (the one that contains `SubModule.xml`) into the `Modules` subfolder of your Bannerlord root.

The final structure on disk must look exactly like this:

```
<BannerlordRoot>\Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\
    SubModule.xml
    install.ps1
    README.md
    ModuleData\
        items.xml
        troops.xml
    bin\
        Win64_Shipping_Client\
            ColoursOfCalradia.dll
        Gaming.Desktop.x64_Shipping_Client\
            ColoursOfCalradia.dll
```

> If `SubModule.xml` ends up one level too deep (e.g. `Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\ColoursOfCalradia\SubModule.xml`) the game will not see the mod. Flatten the folder so `SubModule.xml` sits directly inside `Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\`.

---

### Step 3 — Enable the mod in the launcher

1. Launch **Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord**.
2. In the launcher, click **Mods** in the left panel.
3. Find **Colours of Calradia** in the list and tick the checkbox to enable it.
4. Click **Play**.

> **Load order:** no special position is required. Colours of Calradia has no dependencies on other mods and does not conflict with mods that do not touch the magic or personality systems.

---

### Step 4 — Verify the install worked

Once in-game, start a new campaign. Shortly after the character creation screen you will be presented with **"The Colours of Calradia"** school selection menu. If this screen appears, the mod is installed correctly.

If the screen does not appear:

- Confirm the mod is ticked in the launcher mod list.
- Confirm `SubModule.xml` exists at `<BannerlordRoot>\Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\SubModule.xml`.
- Confirm `ColoursOfCalradia.dll` exists under the correct platform bin folder (see the folder tree above).

---

### Troubleshooting

**Script reports "Could not auto-detect your Bannerlord installation"**

Your game is installed in a non-standard location. Pass the path manually:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -BannerlordPath "D:\Games\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord"
```

**Script reports "DLL not found"**

You are running the script from inside the repository rather than from a release ZIP, and the project has not been built yet. Either download the release ZIP (which includes the pre-built DLL) or build from source first (see *Building from Source* below).

**Script reports "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"**

Run the execution policy bypass command before calling the script:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\install.ps1
```

**The mod list in the launcher does not show Colours of Calradia**

The game scans `<BannerlordRoot>\Modules\` for folders that contain a valid `SubModule.xml` at their root. Verify:

1. The folder is named exactly `ColoursOfCalradia` (no spaces, capital C, capital of C).
2. `SubModule.xml` is directly inside that folder, not in a subfolder.
3. Restart the launcher after copying files — it does not hot-reload.

**Game crashes on load**

The DLL must match the game version's .NET runtime. If the game was recently patched and the crash started afterward, check the Releases page for a compatibility update.

---

### Updating the mod

Re-run `install.ps1` from the new release ZIP. It overwrites all existing mod files automatically. No manual cleanup is needed between versions.

---

### Uninstalling

Delete the folder:

```
<BannerlordRoot>\Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\
```

No registry entries, no save-game data, and no other files are created outside this folder. Removing it is a complete uninstall. Existing saves created with the mod active will continue to load but will not present the school selection screen and will have no magic effects.

---

## Building from Source

Required only if you are contributing or packaging a new release. End users do not need this.

### Requirements

- .NET SDK 6 or later — https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- A local Bannerlord installation (the build references the game's DLLs)

### Environment variables

| Variable | Steam | Xbox / Game Pass |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `BannerlordPath` | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord` | Path to the `Content` folder — find it under `C:\XboxGames\` |
| `BannerlordBin` | `Win64_Shipping_Client` *(default, can be omitted)* | `Gaming.Desktop.x64_Shipping_Client` |

```powershell
# Steam (BannerlordBin defaults to Win64_Shipping_Client)
$env:BannerlordPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord"
dotnet build src\TheWitheringArt.csproj

# Xbox / Game Pass
$env:BannerlordPath = "C:\XboxGames\<GUIDFolder>\Content"
$env:BannerlordBin  = "Gaming.Desktop.x64_Shipping_Client"
dotnet build src\TheWitheringArt.csproj
```

The build auto-deploys `ColoursOfCalradia.dll` into `<BannerlordRoot>\Modules\ColoursOfCalradia\bin\<platform>\` on every successful compile.

Output DLL: `src\bin\Debug\ColoursOfCalradia.dll`

### Creating a release package

```powershell
$env:BannerlordPath = "..."   # must point to a valid Bannerlord install
.\tools\pack.ps1
```

This builds in Release mode and produces `dist\ColoursOfCalradia_v<version>.zip` — the file you upload to Nexus Mods or GitHub Releases. The ZIP includes DLLs for both platforms and the `install.ps1` script.

The project targets `.NET Framework 4.7.2` to match the game's runtime. Logic is split across 18 source files; `MagicSystem.cs` is the module entry point.

---

## Starting the Mod — Colour Selection

When a new campaign starts you will see a multi-selection screen titled **"The Colours of Calradia"**. Hover each colour to read its school flavour text, attribute penalty, and permanent limitation(s).

- Select any combination of colours (including none — you walk an uncoloured path).
- Your chosen colours are **permanent** for that playthrough.
- Each colour you pick reduces one attribute by 1 and locks in a permanent limitation.
- You may select as many as all six colours simultaneously.

### Adjacency and Madness

The six colours form a **spectrum**: **Red — Orange — Yellow — Green — Blue — Purple**. This is a line, not a ring — Red and Purple are at opposite ends and are not adjacent to each other.

If you pick two or more colours that are **not contiguous** on the spectrum (e.g. Red and Yellow, skipping Orange), the incompatible natures fracture your sense of self. **Madness** is applied at game start: two random personality traits shift by ±1, chosen from Mercy, Valor, Honor, Generosity, and Calculating.

Contiguous selections (e.g. Red + Orange + Yellow, or Yellow + Green + Blue) carry no madness penalty from adjacency — but a second rule applies regardless:

**Picking more than 4 colours** triggers **The Fracture** in addition to any adjacency madness:
- Two further random traits shift at game start (stacking on top of adjacency madness if applicable).
- Every **week** thereafter, all five personality traits are randomised completely (each set to a random value between −2 and +2) with no recovery. No mind can hold five colours whole.

### Madness and Battle Orders

Madness does not stay inside your head — it bleeds into command. Whenever you issue a formation order in battle, there is a chance it fires differently from what you intended:

| Cause | Scramble chance |
|-------|-----------------|
| Non-contiguous colour selection | 3 % |
| 5 colours chosen | 5 % |
| 6 colours chosen | 7 % |

When an order is scrambled, the formation receives a random command (Charge or Halt) instead of the one you issued. A message appears in the log. These chances stack independently of each other — a player with 5 non-contiguous colours is subject to the 5 % rule (the higher threshold applies).

---

## The Six Colour Schools

| Colour | Identity | Attribute penalty | Personality drift |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Red** | Blood Price — violent, fiery | Cunning | Calculating −1 |
| **Orange** | Generous Hunger — joyful, open-handed | Intelligence | Generosity +1 |
| **Yellow** | The Fearful Eye — dread, revulsion | Social | Mercy −1 |
| **Green** | Gentle Burden — kind, restorative | Control | Mercy +1 |
| **Blue** | Scholar's Craft — cold, ordered | Vigor | Calculating +1 |
| **Purple** | The Waning Art — melancholic, fading | Endurance | All traits → 0 |

### Limitations by School

Each school carries a permanent limitation that activates on every cast.

**Red — Blood Price**
- **Furious:** Each Red spell automatically issues a Charge order to all your formations.
- **Blood Price:** Each Red spell opens a wound on the caster — 2 HP self-damage.

**Orange — Generous Hunger**
- **Joyful Cast:** You cannot cast Orange magic if your party morale is below 45. The warmth will not flow through misery.

**Yellow — The Fearful Eye**
- **Animal Fear:** You cannot cast Yellow magic from horseback. Animals sense the wrongness and refuse to carry you while you channel it.

**Green — Gentle Burden**
- **Nature's Calling:** You cannot cast Green campaign map spells inside settlements — not in cities, castles, or villages. The colour requires open sky and living earth. (Green has no battle limitation.)

**Blue — Scholar's Craft**
- **Scholar's Craft:** You cannot cast Blue magic in battle while wielding a weapon. Sheathe it first — the colour demands empty hands and a focused mind.

**Purple — The Waning Art**
- **The Slow Unravelling:** Each Purple cast reduces your fertility by 1% and ages you by 1 day — both are permanent. The future, sacrificed piece by piece.

---

## Casting — Controls

### Requirement: Light

**Magic is bound to available light.** The strength of light in your current environment determines whether a spell can be woven at all.

| Light level | When | Effect |
|-------------|------|--------|
| **Bright** | 07:00–20:00 outdoors | Normal casting |
| **Dim** | 05:00–07:00 (dawn) and 20:00–22:00 (dusk); hideout interiors | 33 % chance the spell unravels on cast with no effect |
| **Dark** | 22:00–05:00 (deep night); caves, mines, dungeons | Cannot cast at all |

NPC mage lords require full daylight and will not cast during dim or dark conditions.

### Keyboard

1. Hold **Left Alt** to enter spell mode.
2. Input a **4-key combo** using **W / A / S / D**, which map to:
   - **W** → U (Up)
   - **A** → L (Left)
   - **D** → R (Right)
   - **S** with an empty buffer → opens the spellbook instantly
   - **S** with a non-empty buffer → appends D to the combo (used in Orange, Yellow, Purple suffixes)
3. Release **Left Alt** to fire.

### Gamepad

1. Hold **Left Bumper (LB)** to enter spell mode.
2. Push the **left stick** in a direction:
   - Stick Up → U
   - Stick Down with empty buffer → Open spellbook; with non-empty buffer → D
   - Stick Left → L
   - Stick Right → R
3. Press **L3 (left stick click)** to open the spellbook (instead of casting).
4. Release **Left Bumper** to fire.

### Spellbook

Press **S** (keyboard) or **Left stick Down / L3** (gamepad) while holding the focus key to open the spellbook. The spellbook shows each spell's name, combo (with arrow symbols), and effect, grouped by school and context (Battle / Campaign).

**On the campaign map:** a **Cast a Spell** button opens a selection list of all known campaign map spells. Hover each entry to see its full description and flavour text. Select one and click **Cast** to execute it — preconditions and limitations apply as normal.

**In battle:** a **Guide** button opens the full mechanics reference. A **Back** button returns from the guide.

Controller hint: **Hold LB** then push the left stick.

---

## The Spell System

All 36 spells follow a strict **Form + Colour** combo structure:

- The **first two characters** encode the *form* (how the spell behaves).
- The **last two characters** encode the *colour school*.

### Forms

| Prefix | Keys | Form | Shape / Context |
|--------|------|------|-----------------|
| `UU` | W W | **Blast** | Cone in front of the caster (battle) |
| `RR` | D D | **Self** | Aura or effect centred on the caster (battle) |
| `LL` | A A | **Create** | Persistent area effect placed on the battlefield (battle) |
| `UL` | W A | **Affect** | Campaign map — situational, resource-based |
| `LU` | A W | **Invoke** | Campaign map — advanced, targets heroes and rosters |
| `UR` | W D | **Commune** | Campaign map — ambient, world-affecting |

### Colour Suffixes

| Suffix | School |
|--------|--------|
| `RR` | Red |
| `LD` | Orange |
| `DD` | Yellow |
| `LL` | Green |
| `RU` | Blue |
| `DU` | Purple |

Note: **D** (S key) is valid mid-combo. It cannot appear as the first character of a combo (holding S with an empty buffer opens the spellbook instead).

---

## Spell List

### Blast Spells (UU prefix) — Cone effects

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Crimson Torrent** | `UURR` | Red | 75 damage to all enemies in a forward cone (15 m); pushes them back 6 m (smooth lerp over 0.4 s). |
| **Golden Tide** | `UULD` | Orange | 25 damage to cone enemies (15 m); forces all enemy formations to Charge. |
| **Tide of Dread** | `UUDD` | Yellow | 30 damage to cone enemies (15 m); drains 60 morale from each. |
| **Verdant Surge** | `UULL` | Green | Heals allies in the cone (15 m) for up to 35 HP each. Player and enemies are not affected. |
| **Azure Arrest** | `UURU` | Blue | 28 damage to cone enemies (15 m); drains 35 morale; halts all enemy formations; dismounts riders. |
| **Grey Harvest** | `UUDU` | Purple | Instantly kills 1–3 random creatures in the cone (15 m); kill count scales with Vigor. |

### Self Spells (RR prefix) — Caster-centred effects

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Scarlet Barrier** | `RRRR` | Red | Toggle: six crimson pillars erupt in a ring (radius 4 m) around the caster; any creature inside the ring takes 20 damage every second. Cast again to dismiss. |
| **Gilded Words** | `RRLD` | Orange | Converts one random nearby unmounted non-hero enemy (15 m) to fight for you. |
| **Nausea Bloom** | `RRDD` | Yellow | Persistent 30 s aura (radius 8 m) that deals 35 damage every 2 s to all nearby creatures. |
| **Verdant Touch** | `RRLL` | Green | Heals the caster for 40 HP. |
| **Cerulean Burst** | `RRRU` | Blue | Instant AoE (15 m radius): deals 28 damage to all nearby enemies, drains 35 morale each, halts their formations, and dismounts riders. |
| **Grey Reaping** | `RRDU` | Purple | Drains morale from all nearby enemies; kills 1–2 random non-hero enemies within 15 m (scales with Purple attribute). |

### Create Spells (LL prefix) — Persistent battlefield effects

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Cinder Burst** | `LLRR` | Red | Instant 70 damage to all creatures within 10 m. |
| **Gilded Refuge** | `LLLD` | Orange | Toggle: 3×3 grid of nine inspiring zones (radius 7 m each) across the field — all creatures inside receive +100 morale and 2 HP healing every 2 s. Cast again to dismiss. |
| **Creeping Dread** | `LLDD` | Yellow | Toggle: nine wandering clouds (3×3 grid, radius 7 m each) that roam the field, dealing 45 damage every 2 s to creatures they pass through. Cast again to dismiss. |
| **Emerald Font** | `LLLL` | Green | Toggle: three healing pools in a triangle that restore 25 HP every 2 s to all within — friend and foe alike. Cast again to dismiss. |
| **Sapphire Bastion** | `LLRU` | Blue | Toggle: six pillars of force in a wide line perpendicular to your facing, pushing creatures outward every 0.5 s. Cast again to dismiss. |
| **Purple Mist** | `LLDU` | Purple | Toggle: 3×3 grid of nine dim nodes (radius 4 m each); any non-hero creature inside has a 10% chance to die instantly every 2 s. Cast again to dismiss. |

### Notes on Create Spells

- **Toggled effects** are cancelled by casting the same spell again.
- **Area glows**: Affected agents pulse in the school's colour on each effect tick (approximately every 2 s for most effects, every 0.5 s for Sapphire Bastion). Glow is not applied every frame to avoid performance cost.
- **Smooth movement**: Push and pull effects (Crimson Torrent, Warm Beacon, Sapphire Bastion) move agents using a smoothstep lerp over 0.4 s rather than instant teleportation.

---

## Visual Effects

### Known Limitations

The mod operates at the game-logic layer only and cannot access the engine's animation or particle systems. As a result:

- **No cast animations** — casting a spell produces no hand, body, or weapon animation on the player or NPCs.
- **No area-effect visuals** — Creeping Dread, Nausea Bloom, Purple Mist, and other area effects have no visible cloud or ground texture. Only the agents inside the area glow in the school's colour.
- **No projectile effects** — Blast spells fire instantly; there is no visible projectile.

All visual feedback is limited to **agent glow outlines** (colour pulses on affected characters) and **message log text**.

---

Each school has a distinct colour used for both combat messages and agent glow:

| School | Glow / Message Colour |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Red | Bright red |
| Orange | Orange |
| Yellow | Bright yellow |
| Green | Green |
| Blue | Blue |
| Purple | Purple |

When a spell affects an agent, that agent is outlined in the casting school's colour for 1.5–3 s depending on the effect. The caster themselves glow when activating Self or Create spells.

---

## Personality Drift

Every **25 casts** of the same school shifts one personality trait — but only if the trait actually has room to move (clamped at ±2). A message appears only when the trait moves.

| School | Trait | Direction |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Red | Calculating | −1 |
| Orange | Generosity | +1 |
| Yellow | Mercy | −1 |
| Green | Mercy | +1 |
| Blue | Calculating | +1 |
| Purple | *All traits* | → 0 (each trait moves one step toward zero) |

---

## Tournament Rule

Casting **any** spell during a tournament **immediately disqualifies you** — your character is killed and removed from the match with a warning message.

---

## Level-Up Learning

At character levels 10, 20, 30 … (while you have at least one school but fewer than six), a prompt appears offering you one new colour to learn. You may decline. Accepting applies the new school's attribute penalty and limitations immediately.

---

## Mage Lords (NPC)

### Seeding

At campaign start, one lord per faction is designated as the **archmage** and receives 4 colour schools. Remaining lords each have a random chance of receiving 1–3 schools:

| Schools | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| 3 | 5 % |
| 2 | 7 % |
| 1 | 10 % |
| None | 78 % |

Companion heroes have a **10 % chance** to be granted 1–2 colours when they join your party.

When a mage lord dies, their colours are extinguished. After **7 days**, the colours pass to a randomly selected younger lord (under 50) in the same kingdom. If no suitable candidate exists, the timer retries every day until one becomes available — every kingdom retains at least one mage lord.

### The Prism

One lord in the entire world always carries **all six colour schools** — this is The Prism. They are selected randomly at campaign start from any living non-player lord. The Prism casts in battle at **3× the normal frequency** and their personality shifts randomly every week regardless of cast count. They are feared and distrusted by all other colour lords.

On the campaign map, The Prism has a **20 % independent daily chance** to cast (in addition to reacting whenever another lord casts). Their cooldown after a map cast is 4–6 days.

When The Prism dies, if you carry all six colours and are not already the Prism, there is a **30 % chance** the mantle seeks you next. A prompt appears the following day — you may accept or refuse. If you refuse (or the chance doesn't trigger), a new Prism rises within **one month**.

**Becoming the Prism grants immunity to Madness and Oversaturation.** Your personality will not fracture weekly, and your Saturation cap cannot be depleted.

You may also choose **"I am a Prism"** at character creation (easy mode) to begin with all six colours and full immunity immediately, with no attribute penalties.

### Colour Lord Relationships

Lords who share colour schools are drawn together; those who carry too many schools become feared by their peers.

- Lords with **1–2 schools** who share at least one colour with another 1–2-school lord gain **+5 relations** with them (applied at seeding and whenever a new lord receives colours).
- Lords with **5 or more schools** (including The Prism) take **−5 relations** with every other colour lord, regardless of shared schools.

### Battle Bonus

Colour lords maintain a **morale floor** for their party. Each day, if the party's recent-events morale is below the floor, it is raised to meet it:

| Schools held | Morale floor |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 20 |
| 3 | 30 |
| 4 | 40 |
| 5 | 50 |
| 6 | 60 (cap) |

After each battle resolves, colour lords also **heal a fraction of their wounded troops**. The heal fraction is `colours × 5 %` — a 4-colour lord heals 20 % of each troop type's wounded count.

### Battle AI

NPC mage lords cast in battle using a priority-driven AI:

1. **Self-heal** with Verdant Touch if below 35 % HP (Green lords only).
2. **8 % random wild cast** — fires a random applicable school spell.
3. **Swarm response** — if 3+ enemies within 8 m, prefer Cinder Burst (Red) or Grey Harvest (Purple).
4. **Cone attack** — Crimson Torrent (Red) or Azure Arrest (Blue) if enemies are in the forward arc.
5. **Ally healing** — Verdant Surge (Green) if allies in the forward arc are wounded.
6. **Morale drain** — Tide of Dread (Yellow).
7. **Reinforcement** — Calling (Orange) if outnumbered; Warm Beacon as fallback.

All NPC battle spells require light — the same three-tier rule as the player applies. In dim conditions NPCs have a 33 % chance of their cast failing silently. Lords and companions do not cast for the first **12 seconds** of combat (planning phase). After that, NPC lords have a **40-second base cooldown** between spells, modified by their Calculating trait — Impulsive lords cast 25 % more often (30 s); Calculating lords cast 50 % less often (60 s). The Prism uses a **4-second base cooldown**. Blights cast every **2 seconds** and are exempt from the planning-phase delay.

NPC lords apply their school limitations: Blue lords cannot cast while wielding a weapon (Scholar's Craft); Yellow lords cannot cast from horseback; Orange lords cannot cast if their party morale is below 45. Green lords have no battle limitation (Nature's Calling applies only on the campaign map, where NPCs act through a separate system). After each cast, non-Blight non-Prism lords face an oversaturation risk: **4 % chance** their health drops to 1 (near-certain death against any standing enemy); **5 % chance** of a 3-second knockdown (9 % total — rate-preserved from 11 % at 50 s cooldown scaled to 40 s). Prism and Blights are immune to both.

### Campaign Map Spells

Each mage lord has a **5 % daily chance** to cast a campaign-map spell. At most **1 lord map-cast fires per day** across the entire world. Each lord has a cooldown of **12–16 days** after casting. The Prism additionally has a **20 % independent daily chance** to cast (cooldown 4–6 days), and also reacts when any other lord casts.

| School | Effect A (33 %) | Effect B (33 %) | Effect C (33 %) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Red** | Own party morale +10 (*Bloodlust*) | Random enemy village hearth ×0.8 (*Carnage*) | Sacrifice soldier → morale +15 (*Crimson Tithe*) |
| **Orange** | Nearest friendly village hearth ×1.05 (*Celebrate*) | Transfer 1–2 troops from rival lord (*Bribe*) | Nearby lord/notable relations +3 (*Good Word*) |
| **Yellow** | Random enemy lord renown −10 (*Fade*) | Random enemy party morale −15 (*Terror*) | Enemy town loyalty −10 (*Sow Doubt*) |
| **Green** | Heal up to 3 wounded per troop type (*Rejuvenate*) | Add 5 grain to own inventory (*Crops*) | Own village hearth +15 (*Verdant Bond*) |
| **Blue** | Own clan influence +8 (*Schemes*) | Enemy clan influence −8 (*Plots*) | Nearest enemy party morale −10 (*Arcane Sight*) |
| **Purple** | Enemy influence −5, enemy morale −10 (*Curse*) | Add 10 recruits to own party (*Bind*) | Enemy lord age +3 days, renown −2 (*Grey Curse*) |

## Named Magical Units

### Seeding

Named magical soldiers are seeded sparingly to keep large-battle performance stable:

| Party Type | Condition | Units | Daily reseed chance |
|------------|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Lord party | 200–349 troops | 1 unit (1 colour) | 5 % |
| Lord party | 350+ troops | 2 units (1 colour each) | 5 % |
| Bandit party | 40+ troops | 1 unit (1 colour) | 1 % |

The named lord or companion in a party is always the primary magic user; the unit soldiers are rare additions who only appear in the largest armies.

When a unit dies in battle, they re-enter a **3–5 day respawn queue** and re-emerge in a party of the same type: lord-party units respawn in the next qualifying large lord party (200+ troops); bandit units respawn in the next qualifying bandit party (40+ troops). If no suitable party is available, the queue retries every 5 days until one appears.

Each named unit receives 1 colour school. Their names are generated from a pool of 20 first names combined with school-specific suffixes:

| School | Suffixes |
|--------|----------|
| Red | the Ember, Bloodhanded, Pyremark |
| Orange | the Bright, Goldenvoiced, the Warm |
| Yellow | the Pale, of Dread, the Craven |
| Green | the Tender, Root-spoken, the Verdant |
| Blue | the Still, Coldwater, the Patient |
| Purple | the Hollow, the Grey, the Fading |

### Battle Behaviour

Named magical units do not cast for the first **12 seconds** of combat (matching the lord planning-phase delay). After that, they cast with a **120-second cooldown** and a **0.5 s AI evaluation tick**. Each cast carries the same oversaturation risk as lords: **4 % lethal** (health → 1) and **5 % knockdown** (3 s stagger) — 9 % total. The same light-level restriction applies — dim conditions carry a 33 % silent failure chance.

### Campaign Map Effects

Each named unit has a **3 % daily chance** to trigger a minor campaign map effect. At most **1 unit map-cast fires per day** total. After casting, a unit cannot cast on the map again for **6–9 days**. Effects are generally positive for the unit's own party (morale, experience, food).

## Children & Companions

### Children

Children of the main hero inherit colours based on how much magical potential surrounds their birth:

- **Guaranteed** when the player has **2 or more colours**, or when both parents carry colours (player + colour lord spouse).
- **50 % chance** otherwise (player has only 1 colour, other parent is not a colour lord).

When a child inherits:

- They always share at least one school with the player.
- Their total number of schools equals the player's count ±1, clamped to 1–6.
- Any remaining slots are filled from the pool of colours the player does not already hold.
- A notification appears at birth naming the schools they carry.

Children of **two NPC colour lords** (not involving the player) also have a chance to inherit. Guaranteed when both parents are colour lords; 50 % if only one is. These children gain 1–2 schools drawn from their parents' combined school pool with no player notification.

### Companions

When a companion joins your party they have a **10 % chance** to carry colour gifts:

- 10 % of that chance: 2 colours.
- 20 % of that chance: 1 colour.
- Otherwise: no colours.

A message announces how many colours they carry when they join.

---

## Colour Spectrum Reference

```
Red (0) — Orange (1) — Yellow (2) — Green (3) — Blue (4) — Purple (5)
```

The colours form a **spectrum**, not a ring. Adjacent colours on the spectrum do not cause Madness. Non-adjacent combinations (e.g. Red + Yellow, or Red + Purple) do. Red and Purple are at opposite ends — they are never adjacent regardless of what else you pick.

## Campaign Map Spells

Three spell forms work exclusively on the campaign map and require the same daytime light conditions as battle spells. They cannot be cast during battles. Green Invoke/Affect spells additionally cannot be cast while inside a settlement (Nature's Calling).

### Affect Spells (UL prefix) — situation-based

Each Affect spell is tied to a specific situation or resource. Saturation cost is the only shared limiter.

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Pillager's Brand** | `ULRR` | Red | Curse a random enemy village at war — hearth falls by 10%. |
| **Rallying Call** | `ULLD` | Orange | Your party finds new resolve — morale +2. |
| **Press Gang** | `ULDD` | Yellow | Conscript one random prisoner from your prison roster into the ranks — they join unwillingly. Morale −2. |
| **Mending Touch** | `ULLL` | Green | 50% chance to heal one wounded soldier. Cannot be cast inside a settlement. |
| **Philosopher's Stone** | `ULRU` | Blue | Gold flows: +50×power. Time ebbs — you become 1 day younger (minimum age 22). |
| **Pale Dirge** | `ULDU` | Purple | The nearest enemy party at war loses up to 5 soldiers and 20 morale. |

### Invoke Spells (LU prefix) — advanced campaign effects

Invoke spells target heroes, rosters, and rival lords directly.

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Withering Strike** | `LURR` | Red | Wound one random healthy soldier in the nearest enemy party at war. |
| **Inspired Word** | `LULD` | Orange | Grant one random soldier in your party 150×power experience. |
| **Creeping Fear** | `LUDD` | Yellow | The nearest enemy party at war loses 2 morale. |
| **Green's Bounty** | `LULL` | Green | 80% grain / 10% sheep / 10% cow ripens at your touch. Cannot be cast inside a settlement. |
| **Blue Influence** | `LURU` | Blue | Gain 5 influence. Kingdom membership required. |
| **Wither's Touch** | `LUDU` | Purple | A random enemy lord's clan loses 2 renown. Cost: −1% fertility + 1 day aging. |

### Commune Spells (UR prefix) — ambient, world-affecting

Commune spells reach beyond your immediate position to reshape the world around you.

| Spell | Combo | School | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Crimson Tithe** | `URRR` | Red | Sacrifice one soldier — a random combat skill gains 200×power XP. Party morale −1. |
| **Good Word** | `URLD` | Orange | Your warmth reaches a random lord or notable — relations +1. |
| **Sow Doubt** | `URDD` | Yellow | Unease spreads through a random enemy town — loyalty −10. |
| **Verdant Bond** | `URLL` | Green | A friendly village is blessed — hearth +20. |
| **Arcane Sight** | `URRU` | Blue | The Scholar's eye opens — shows the 10 nearest colour lords with their schools and distances in a popup dialog. |
| **Grey Curse** | `URDU` | Purple | A random enemy lord ages 3 days and their clan loses 2 renown. Cost: −1% fertility + 1 day aging. |

### Notes

- **Purple** campaign spells that tap The Waning Art (Wither's Touch, Grey Curse) apply The Slow Unravelling: −1% fertility + 1 day aging per cast. Pale Dirge does not carry this cost.
- **Green** Mending Touch and Green's Bounty cannot be cast inside a settlement (Nature's Calling).
- **Blue** Philosopher's Stone respects a minimum age of 22 — no further rejuvenation below that threshold.
- **Orange** Rallying Call and Inspired Word work anywhere with no additional resource cost.
- **Red** Pillager's Brand requires an active war with the target village's faction.

## Saturation

Every cast generates **0–5 Saturation** at random. Saturation represents how much absorbed light your body holds at once. The cap grows with your level: **max = hero level + 10** (no upper limit — the more experienced you are, the more light you can hold).

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Saturation reaches max | **Oversaturation** |
| Darkness falls (22:00–05:00 or dark location) | Saturation resets to 0 |

### Oversaturation

When you hit the cap, the light tears through you:
- Knocked down for **3 seconds** (in battle)
- A random personality trait shifts by ±1
- Your **max Saturation permanently decreases by 1**

### Max Depletion

When max Saturation reaches **0**, you must choose:

| Choice | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Surrender your colours** | All colour schools are lost permanently. Others will inherit them in time. |
| **Embrace the Blight** | You keep your colours and become immune to all future Oversaturation — but every living lord's opinion of you collapses by −100 immediately and permanently. |

### Immunity

- **Blights** are immune to all Oversaturation effects.
- **The Prism** (NPC or player) is immune to Madness and Oversaturation.

### NPC Saturation

- Every NPC colour lord has a **5 % chance of a 3-second knockdown** after each battle cast.
- Every week there is a **5 % chance** a random NPC colour lord oversaturates:
  - **79 % outcome:** they lose all colours. Another lord in the same kingdom inherits them within 7 days.
  - **21 % outcome:** they die and a Blight of one of their colours spawns immediately. **Blights no longer auto-respawn** — each Blight that is slain is gone until the next oversaturation event spawns one.
